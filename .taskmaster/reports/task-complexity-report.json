		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Elm Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard Elm project setup with directory creation, dependency configuration, and basic file initialization, which is straightforward with low technical challenges and minimal dependencies. Testing is simple compilation and basic rendering. No expansion needed as it's a single, cohesive setup step."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define Core Types and Model",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Defining Elm types requires careful design for immutability and type safety across multiple aliases and union types, with moderate effort in ensuring compatibility. It depends on project setup and involves unit testing for decoders, but the implementation is focused and doesn't warrant subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Decoders and HTTP Requests",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for creating JSON decoders for each endpoint (project, tasks, prds, stats, prd content) and implementing HTTP request functions with error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This involves creating multiple decoders and HTTP functions, which can be error-prone due to JSON parsing and API integration. It has dependencies and requires both unit and integration testing, increasing complexity. Recommended subtasks to handle decoders and requests separately for better manageability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Basic View Rendering and Layout",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Implementing basic HTML layout and integration with Elm's view is moderately complex due to ensuring responsive design and CSS preservation, but it's a standard UI setup with clear dependencies. Testing involves rendering checks, and it's manageable as one task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Task List and Hierarchical Rendering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for implementing recursive rendering of tasks and subtasks, and adding expand/collapse state management in Update.elm.",
			"reasoning": "Handling hierarchical task rendering recursively with state tracking (using Sets) introduces technical challenges in logic and performance for large trees. Dependencies on types and layout add effort, and testing hierarchical behavior is involved. Subtasks help separate rendering from state logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add Task Selection and Detail Panel",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on updating model state for selection and rendering detailed views, with moderate complexity in ensuring independent subtask expansion. It builds on prior tasks and involves straightforward testing, fitting as a single unit without needing expansion."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Filtering and Search Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for creating filter functions in Utils/Task.elm (status, priority, text search with hierarchical logic) and updating Update.elm for message handling and UI integration.",
			"reasoning": "The filtering logic, especially hierarchical matching and combining filters, is technically challenging and requires careful implementation to avoid performance issues. Dependencies and combined testing increase effort, so subtasks separate utility functions from update logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build PRD Viewer with Markdown Rendering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for implementing PRDList.elm for listing documents and PRDViewer.elm for loading and rendering content with ports for markdown.",
			"reasoning": "Involves API integration, content rendering, and JavaScript interop via ports, which adds complexity in handling markdown and preserving syntax. Dependencies on API and views, plus port testing, make it suitable for subtasks to isolate list and viewer components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Advanced Features: Stats, Context Bar, Hot Reload",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for implementing Stats.elm dashboard, adding context bar in Header.elm, and setting up SSE ports for hot reloading with state preservation.",
			"reasoning": "Combining multiple features like stats calculation, UI additions, and real-time reloading with state preservation is highly complex, involving interdependencies and advanced Elm features. Testing across features is extensive, warranting subtasks for each major component."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Polish, Optimize, and Set Up Build Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for integrating CSS and adding error handling/loading states, and configuring build scripts and binary packaging for production.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers optimization, UI polishing, and build setup across multiple areas, with moderate complexity in performance tuning and cross-platform testing. Dependencies on all prior work make it integrative, but subtasks help separate polishing from build pipeline setup."
